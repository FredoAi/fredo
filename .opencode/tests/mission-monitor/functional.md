# Mission Monitor — Functional Test Cases (Spec #2791 — Ghost sessions)

> Durable functional suite (feature domain `mission-monitor`). One `- [ ]` case per requirement; observable expected outcome per case.
>
> **Evidence policy: LIVE** — the exit gate / audit fail-closed unless the tester's Evidence references `telemetry_spans` (a live-query result) for the emission/observability ACs. A static-only PASS is a FALSE PASS.
>
> Fixture doctrine (G-073/G-076/G-080): drive via Fredo's Run CLI feature (free model, minimal session trees, unique marker in the FIRST prompt); assert DOM only on COMPLETED sessions whose telemetry agrees at the same instant; never run the `opencode` binary from a shell.

## Ghost-session fix (AC1 / AC2 / AC3)

- [x] F-1 (REQ-1, PASS 2026-09-02 #2791): Drive a normal opencode session via Run CLI (free model, minimal tree, marker in first prompt). Wait for the telemetry store to confirm its rows landed, then select it in Mission Monitor's session list and snapshot the canvas (DOM + screenshot).
  - EXPECTED: canvas renders ≥1 graph node (ChatNode / SubagentNode / embedded `── TOOLS (N) ──` section); DOM snapshot shows the node set AND a `telemetry_spans` query returns the landed chat/tool/agent-session rows for that session at the same instant (G-073.3).
  - Edge: (d) normal session graph renders normally, unaffected.
- [x] F-2 (REQ-1a, PASS 2026-09-02 #2791): Select a listed session that lands zero visible graph nodes (ghost / transitional / subagent-only).
  - EXPECTED: canvas renders the explicit explanatory state (plain-language message stating no graph content is available); DOM snapshot shows the explanatory-state element AND zero graph nodes. Never a silent blank canvas.
  - Edge: (a) transitional-turn session (landed rows + zero visible nodes) → explanatory state; (b) subagent-only / composited session → explanatory state, never silent blank.
- [x] F-3 (REQ-2, PASS 2026-09-02 #2791): Inspect the session list for a session with landed telemetry rows + zero rendered graph nodes.
  - EXPECTED: the session is EITHER excluded from the list OR, if listed, surfaces the explanatory state. It is NOT presented as an ordinary session with a blank canvas.
  - Edge: (e) one ghost among many listed sessions → only the ghost shows the state (or is excluded); others unaffected.
- [x] F-4 (REQ-3, PASS 2026-09-02 #2791): Select a session immediately after launch before its first spans land (zero nodes, zero landed spans).
  - EXPECTED: the transient empty state still renders (zero nodes + empty-state message), NOT replaced by the ghost explanatory state. After spans land, resolves to content-or-explanation. Legitimate transient is not regressed (G-074).
  - Edge: (c) zero-landed-span transient not regressed; must NOT be a silent blank.
- [x] F-5 (REQ-3a, PASS 2026-09-02 #2791): For a landing-in-progress session, observe zero spans → landed rows → content-or-explanation.
  - EXPECTED: state stable and observable at each stage; no flicker, no silent-blank window at the landed-rows stage. Cross-check DOM vs `telemetry_spans` at the same instant (G-073.3).
- [x] F-6 (REQ-3b, PASS 2026-09-02 #2791): Drive two sequential fixtures; confirm each resolves consistently.
  - EXPECTED: each session consistently resolves to content-or-explanation per its landed rows at the same instant; no session flips between blank / ghost / content without a corresponding telemetry change.
  - Edge: G-076 marker-resolved session ids; subagents joined via the parent task-span child-session attribute + the child's parent-relationship attribute.

## Non-functional (NFR-1 / NFR-2 / NFR-3)

- [x] N-1 (NFR-1, PASS 2026-09-02 #2791): With several listed sessions, verify the session-list derivation is a single map pass (no per-session rescan) and the list does not lag/block.
  - EXPECTED: list renders within normal time; no O(n²) blocking; code inspection confirms a single map pass (no re-deriving the graph per listed session).
  - Regression risk: a fix that re-derives the graph per listed session violates NFR-1 → FAIL.
- [x] N-2 (NFR-2, PASS 2026-09-02 #2791): After each interaction, read the webview JS console (`tauri_read_logs source="console"`).
  - EXPECTED: no `Error:` / `Uncaught` / `Maximum update depth exceeded` / re-render-loop symptom; recomputation is monotonic-epoch based (per #523).
  - Regression risk (#523): a `useEffect` depending on array `.length` or newly-created object refs → FAIL.
- [x] N-3 (NFR-3, PASS 2026-09-02 #2791): Verify no graph-node layout/color/edge change, no ingestion/storage/classification change, no v1 hydration/fallback reintroduced.
  - EXPECTED: graph renders with pre-fix node layout/colors/edges across all sessions; `useEventRows` is the only row source; no `??` fallback chains / multi-path lookups reintroduced.
  - Regression risk (Contract-Trust Cleanup): no defensive fallback extraction / event-level rewrite.
